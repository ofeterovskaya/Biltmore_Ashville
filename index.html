<p>Stroll acres of formal and informal gardens designed by America’s foremost landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. From the beauty of the Italian Garden to the breathtaking trees in America’s first managed forest, Biltmore’s lush landscape is a living tribute to Olmsted’s genius. Our horticultural experts continually work to preserve the original vision for the gardens and grounds, including our Rose Garden that features more than 250 varieties.
  
  As a century-old model for forest conservation (and, more recently, for sustainability, thanks to six acres of solar panels), Biltmore continues to honor Vanderbilt’s legacy of environmental protection.

		  <p>Here at Biltmore, hundreds of vibrant chrysanthemums and salvias fill the Walled Garden, Estate Entry, and Winery beds during the fall. The mountains of western North Carolina have the most diverse forest anywhere in the U.S. Because of this, our fall color stretches out longer and has more variety.</p>
          <img src="images/Parker-Andes.jpg" width="540" height="405" alt=""/>
		  <p><b>Parker Andes, our Director of Horticulture,</b> has this to say about this week's fall color forecast:</p>
		  <p><i>
  "Despite the warm weather, fall is arriving right on time. Autumn colors are really beginning to show at higher elevations; on the estate we are now getting our first look of fall on a larger scale. While it is still too early for what might be called peak color, red maples and sugar maples are showing color and they are some of our most reliable trees. As guests take the Approach Road up to the house, maroon dogwoods, light red sourwoods, and hints of yellow on hickory are kicking things off beautifully. The shrubs and ferns have color down low and add to the overall beauty of the landscape.<br>

          In the formal gardens the berries are attracting song birds in good numbers and Viburnum, Sweetspire, and other shrubs actually provide some of the best leaf color. In the Shrub and Azalea Garden, Japanese maples offer a blush of color which will get better each day through the last week of October. Fall does have its own fragrances; on sunny warm days in the Azalea garden, guests can smell a cotton candy scent coming from the yellow leaves of several Katsura trees. The oaks across the estate are still mostly green; they will offer the best of our color in late October or early November, depending on when we get a frost.<br>

          The fall mums, salvias, and color accent plants are at their peak in the formal beds across the estate. The gardeners have put together some wonderful combinations that make beautiful backdrops for family and group photographs.With no frost yet, roses across the estate are still blooming, and guests may notice that gardeners are no longer deadheading them, but letting the flowers finish on their own. We do this to help the plant go dormant and be ready for the cold weather to come."</i></p>

      <div class="ui-collapsible-content ui-body-inherit" aria-hidden="false">
		  <p>In 1971, George Vanderbilt’s grandson William Cecil first experimented with winemaking at Biltmore at his new North Carolina vineyard. From a harvest of French-American hybrid grapes planted within sight of Biltmore House, the inaugural vintage was bottled in the estate Conservatory.</p>

	<p>Unsatisfied with the wine (it would later be dubbed “the crush of horror”), Mr. Cecil sought advice from experts in the field of winemaking at the University of California at Davis. Although the researchers were uncertain that vinifera cultivation was truly possible in western North Carolina vineyards because of general growing conditions in the region, they worked closely with Mr. Cecil to suggest new advances in grape-growing methods and technology.</p>

	<p>Mr. Cecil continued his effort to achieve his dream of making wine at Biltmore by moving the vineyard to the west side of the estate and expanding to 150 acres of vinifera grapes. In 1977, Mr. Cecil traveled to France to persuade sixth-generation French winemaster Philippe Jourdain to oversee the development of Biltmore wines and to help build the future of what would become the Biltmore Estate Wine Company.</p>

	<p>In the decades since, Biltmore has grown and tested numerous varietals. Six of them – Riesling, Chardonnay, Viognier, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot – have proven to be particularly well-suited for our western North Carolina terroir and the microclimate of the estate. We continue to evaluate other varietals in a special test vineyard behind the winery. In an effort to expand our portfolio and consistently craft the highest quality wine possible, we also partner with select growers in North Carolina, Washington State, and throughout California, including Sonoma and Napa.</p>

	<p>Today, we continue to honor the Vanderbilt heritage of agriculturally based sustainability as well as Mr. Cecil’s legacy. We are proud of his vision and hard work that have created diversification opportunities in harmony with Biltmore’s mission.</p>

		A native of France, Bernard joined the Biltmore Wine Company as assistant winemaker in 1986, rising to the position of winemaster in 1991. Bernard is especially fond of sparkling wines and enjoys crafting them according to the traditional méthode champenoise. According to Bernard, sparkling wines aren’t just for celebrations – they’re surprisingly food-friendly as well.<br>

<p>Sharon’s passion for winemaking brought her to Biltmore in 1999, and she attained winemaker status in 2003. In addition to creating fine wines, Sharon is also involved in research and development for new grape-growing technology and production methods.<br>

	<i>“As Biltmore wines continue to grow,”</i> Sharon says, <i>“I hope to continue building the tradition of the Biltmore brand among wine enthusiasts locally, nationally, and globally.”</i><br>

		Before Biltmore, Sharon crafted wines for two different Georgia wineries. The Pennsylvania native holds a master’s degree in food science from the University of Georgia, a bachelor’s degree in food science from Penn State University, and has served in both the US Army and the US Army Reserves. Sharon became interested in wine while stationed in Vicenza, Italy.</p>
